# Get This Done

This is a (not so basic) todo app made with Svelte. Featuring in particular many of the built-in animations of Svelte.

You can create several lists of tasks. Each task has a name, priority, completed status. Each can be deleted or moved to a different list. The order of the tasks can be changed. Each list can be sorted by priority or alphabetically and filtered for completed status. Of course it can also be renamed and deleted.

There is also a list of all tasks (when you have created at least two lists). Naturally, you cannot delete that list or add tasks to it.

This is a pure frontend application. The lists are saved in the localStorage of your browser.
